## Introduction
This project is a **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Management System (SCMS)** that aims to address common challenges in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including operational inefficiencies, counterfeiting risks, and complex regulatory requirements. Our SCMS improves transparency, security, and efficiency across various rolesâ€”users, suppliers, and administrators.

## Project Overview
The SCMS is designed to serve as an inventory management and order-tracking system specifically for the pharmaceutical industry. It allows stakeholders to interact seamlessly, enabling the following:
- **Users**: Browse products, add items to cart, place orders, and track order history.
- **Suppliers**: Process orders, manage inventory, and view sales analytics.
- **Administrators**: Oversee user management, inventory, and system reporting.

The current version of the project includes a Home page, Feedback page, Login page, Register page, and Payment page developed using HTML and CSS (frontend only).

## Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login system using Firebase Authentication.
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations for inventory management through Firebase Firestore.
- **Order Management**: Create and manage orders, with users able to place orders and suppliers managing their side.
- **Shipment Tracking**: Real-time tracking and notifications for shipments and deliveries.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Provides insights on inventory levels, orders, and shipment status.
